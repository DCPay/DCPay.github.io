							DCPay has a multi-located gateway system which is primarily hosted in Hong Kong. The China payment gateway system allows your business to securely accept payments online in any major currency and offers leading reliability with a 99.999% network uptime SLA. For merchants based outside of China, the DCPay processing gateway will enable your business to accept payments online in Yuan, and then settle to your bank account in almost any major currency such as USD and GBP*. With DCPay, you do not need a Chinese Bank account to accept online payments from China; our third-party web payment gateway system caters for this.

							DCPay offers a comprehensive and affordable credit card processing service for all types of small businesses. We like that it lets you accept credit cards in different ways — with a credit card machine, mobile phone, tablet POS system and online — and that there are different pricing options based on your sales volume. The company also offers a merchant account, including those for high-risk businesses that often have difficulty obtaining one. Payline also comes with 24/7 phone support, as well as e-mail, helpdesk and live chat support.
